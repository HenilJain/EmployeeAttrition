[![Python](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/tensorflow.svg?style=plastic)](https://badge.fury.io/py/tensorflow)

Employee Attrition and Turnover Prediction using machine learning is a process of predicting whether an employee is likely to leave a company or not. It is a critical task for organizations, as high attrition rates can negatively impact productivity and result in increased costs for recruitment and training. Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze various factors that contribute to employee attrition, such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, salary, and benefits. These factors are often represented as features in the data and used to train a model. The goal of the model is to predict an employee's likelihood of leaving based on these features.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions for new employees, allowing organizations to take proactive measures to address potential attrition issues. For example, the model might suggest offering an employee a raise, providing them with more flexible work hours, or improving the overall work environment. By using machine learning to predict attrition, organizations can take a data-driven approach to reducing turnover and improving employee retention.
